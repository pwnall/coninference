Steps for configuring an Edison device:
-----

git clone https://github.com/pwnall/edison-cup
load the project and install on the board

If setting up a new board from scratch, go through all of README.md. But in practice, just do this (replacing SERVER_HOST with the appropriate hostname/ip):

mkdir -p ~/.edison-cup
echo "http://SERVER_HOST:3000" > ~/.edison-cup/server.url

Run the project.
